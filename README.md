# JSLeafletChallenge

## Notes:
This project was written with significant help from StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks and drew heavily from the code written in previous lessons
The project also uses the leaflet module to construct maps and markers from data pulled from USGS

## Instructions:
A text editor (like VS code) with Live Service capabilities must be used to open the logic file in Module 15 Challenge\Starter_Code\static\js

After the logic file is opened, simply press "go live" your default internet browser should load the page

Map controls are similar to most maps online, and hovering over dots will give a breif description of each point
