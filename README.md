# JSLeafletChallenge

## Purpose:
This project showcases the d3 and leaflet module of javascript by creating a basic visuallization of earthquakes around the world. 

Size of the dot is based on earthquake magnitude, while color is based on depth. Dots are centered on the coordinates of the earthquake.


## Notes:
This project was written with significant help from StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks and drew heavily from the code written in previous lessons
The project also uses the leaflet module to construct maps and markers from data pulled from USGS

## Instructions:
A text editor (like VS code) with Live Service capabilities must be used to open the logic file in Module 15 Challenge\Starter_Code\static\js

After the logic file is opened, simply drag the Starter_Code folder into the workspace Explorer and press "Go Live". your default internet browser should load the page

Map controls are similar to most maps online, and hovering over dots will give a breif description of each point.
